## gamescreated repo
I love playing games! I have played many tiny, different games on my mobile developed by indie developers and a few big titles on my PC and on a PS (mainly coz I was a bit broke to own a PS of my own and now I get to play a bit at my university).

I recently found that I love making games too! I randomly sat for a class about Introduction to Game Design and Development, just for fun, at my university (UNCC) and I ended up taking the course for real for my 1st semester of my masters here!
I have fallen in love with this field. 

This repo is for the games I have made so far and the future games that I will make, so my future grandkids can brag about how cool their grandma is to their friends (life goals..) <3

The two games currently here have been created by my team, Excelsior, during the 1st semester at UNC Charlotte, as part of our Introduction to Game Development class.
